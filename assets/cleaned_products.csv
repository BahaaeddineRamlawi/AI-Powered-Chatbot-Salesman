HIGHLIGHTS:
Pea protein is a Ã¢ÂÂcomplete protein,Ã¢ÂÂ but itÃ¢ÂÂs low in one vital amino acid.
Unlike some plant-based protein powders, pea protein is well digested and highly bioavailable.
Pea protein is almost as good as whey protein for building muscle, feeling satiated, and recovering from workouts.

Absolutely! Raisins have many health benefits! Raisins are a low fat food and provide less than 120 calories per serving. They contribute to our daily intake of fiber, vitamins, and essential minerals. Antioxidant powerhouses, raisins provide only natural sugars. As nutritious as they are delicious, raisins make for a great healthy snack for kids by helping them reach the recommended five to nine daily servings of fruit.
Are raisins grapes?
They sure are. Raisins are simply dried grapes. Most raisins come from the Thompson Seedless Grapes variety. Due to the dehydration that takes place in dried fruits, raisins have more concentrated nutrition levels than grapes, making them a natural, nutritious, easy and healthy snack for kids and adults alike.
What are raisins good for?
Besides being a tasty and healthy snack all on their own, raisins are a welcome addition to many recipes. Due to their natural sugars, raisins are a useful component in healthy breakfast ideas, like sprinkling over granola or adding to fruit salads. Raisins are also a popular item in healthy snack and dessert recipes.

The small, sun-dried fruit is packed with nutritional goodness that provides a boost of energy, a good source of fiber, and various essential vitamins and minerals that do your body good.
Here are six reasons you should make raisins one of your new favorite snacks:
Get an instant energy boost: Raisins are rich in carbohydrates, especially natural sugars, so they make a great pre- or post-workout energy-boosting snack.
Prevent constipation: Raisins are a good source of dietary fiber which can promote good digestive health.
Reduce the risk of heart disease, diabetes, and other chronic diseases: A 2013 study in the Ã¢ÂÂJournal of Food ScienceÃ¢ÂÂ showed that eating raisins regularly led to lower blood glucose levels, reduced blood pressure, lower cholesterol levels, and lower overall food consumption due to an increased feeling of fullness.
Prevent or combat anemia: Raisins are a powerhouse of iron, which helps to treat anemia as well as to improve circulation.
Help with sexual dysfunction: Raisins include an amino acid, known as Arginine, which has been known to stimulate the libido and induce arousal.
Ensure good health for your eyes and bones: There is a large number of phytonutrients in raisins that make them good for vision.
So, next time youÃ¢ÂÂre looking for a healthy snack, reach for a handful of raisins! There are so many ways to enjoy raisins. You can eat them plain, add them to your salad, oatmeal, desserts or potatoes, sprinkle them on top of your celery and peanut butter sticks, or cover them in yogurt and add it to your trail mix.

  PREPARATION
Measure the amount of cold water you will need.
Place your pot of water on the stove and turn the heat to medium-high enough to heat up the water
Add about 1-2 heaping tea spoons (or 1 tablespoon) of coffee per demitasse cup (3 oz). Do not stir it yet. Just let the coffee Ã¢ÂÂfloatÃ¢ÂÂ on the surface because if you stir it now you might cause it to clump up.
Add sugar to taste. Do not stir it yet, Let the water warm up little bit as above.
When the coffee starts to sink into the water and the water is warm enough to dissolve your sugar, stir it several times and then turn down the heat to low. You should stir it several times, up until your brew starts to foam
When you see the bubble Ã¢ÂÂringÃ¢ÂÂ forming on the surface, turn down the heat a little bit more or move your pot away from the heat source. Pay attention to the bubbles that are forming at this stage. Bubbles should be very small in size.
From this point on watch your coffee carefully. Do not let the temperature get hot enough to start boiling.
The key idea here is to let the coffee build a thick froth and that occurs approximately around 158 F or 70 C
Keep it at the Ã¢ÂÂfoamingÃ¢ÂÂ stage as long as you can without letting it come to a boil. You might even gently stir your brew a little bit at this stage. The more froth, the better it will taste.

PREPARATION
Measure the amount of cold water you will need.
Place your pot of water on the stove and turn the heat to medium-high enough to heat up the water
Add about 1-2 heaping tea spoons (or 1 tablespoon) of coffee per demitasse cup (3 oz). Do not stir it yet. Just let the coffee Ã¢ÂÂfloatÃ¢ÂÂ on the surface because if you stir it now you might cause it to clump up.
Add sugar to taste. Do not stir it yet, Let the water warm up little bit as above.
When the coffee starts to sink into the water and the water is warm enough to dissolve your sugar, stir it several times and then turn down the heat to low. You should stir it several times, up until your brew starts to foam
When you see the bubble Ã¢ÂÂringÃ¢ÂÂ forming on the surface, turn down the heat a little bit more or move your pot away from the heat source. Pay attention to the bubbles that are forming at this stage. Bubbles should be very small in size.
From this point on watch your coffee carefully. Do not let the temperature get hot enough to start boiling.
