How should I store the Lebanese coffee?,"To store Lebanese coffee properly and maintain its freshness, here are some tips:

1. **Airtight Container**: Use an airtight container to keep the coffee away from air, which can cause it to go stale. Glass jars or vacuum-sealed bags work well.

2. **Cool, Dark Place**: Store the container in a cool, dark place, away from direct sunlight and heat sources. A pantry or cupboard is ideal.

3. **Avoid Moisture**: Keep the coffee away from moisture, as it can lead to mold growth. Make sure your hands are dry when handling the coffee.

4. **Whole Beans vs. Ground**: If you have whole beans, consider grinding them just before brewing to preserve flavor. Ground coffee tends to lose its freshness more quickly.

How can I tell if the dried fruit has gone bad?,"To determine if dried fruit has gone bad, there are a few signs you can look for:

1. **Appearance**: Check for any discoloration or mold. Fresh dried fruit should have a consistent color and no visible signs of spoilage.

2. **Texture**: If the fruit feels excessively hard, dry, or has a strange texture, it may be past its prime. Fresh dried fruit should still have some flexibility and a pleasant crunch.

3. **Smell**: A sour or off smell is a clear indicator that the fruit has spoiled. Fresh dried fruit should have a sweet, fruity aroma.

4. **Taste**: If you're unsure, a small taste can help. If it tastes off or has an unusual flavor, it's best to discard it.
